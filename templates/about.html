<div class="about-gp">
  <h3 class="about-title">How it works</h3>
  <p class="about-text">If it is your first visit to the site, you can search for books via the search engine or scroll through the available books in the scroll bar window on the home page.
  If you see a book that you like and want to reqeust a swap, you need to be signed up and logged in. 
  <br><br>
  Create an account by clicking on the signup link which is found on the home screen, the about screen and the login screen.
  <br><br>
  Once you have created an account you will be directed to the logged in page and now when you click on a link from the book list in the scroll bar window, to a book detail page, 
  you will be able to request a swap on any book that you haven't added yourself.
  <br><br>
  Now as a logged in user you can also add your own book by clicking on the add book button, that can be found on the logged in book list page, adding the required details then pressing save.
  Your book will now be available for other users to view and request.
  <br><br>
  Once you make a request for a swap, the book owner will recieve an email message to let them know about the swap request.
  <br><br>
  Happy book swapping!
